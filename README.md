# elementary-desktop

This project was aiming to test if I could make a "missing" desktop for Elementary OS in QT, unfortunatelly it did not succeed in it due the
various problems related with QT (buggy support of drag and drop and several other minor things). But that might change in the future :)

However I've switched to Mint, and it's very unlikely that it's gonna be supported.
